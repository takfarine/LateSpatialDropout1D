# LateSpatialDropout1D: Delayed Spatial Dropout in TensorFlow

Introducing `LateSpatialDropout1D`, a custom TensorFlow layer designed to offer the spatial dropout functionality with a delayed start. This approach is beneficial for more nuanced training regimes, where regularization, like dropout, is introduced only after the model has undergone initial training epochs without it.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Delayed Start for Dropout**: Add dropout regularization only after a specified number of training steps.
- **Ease of Integration**: Seamlessly fits into any TensorFlow/Keras model.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Set your desired dropout rate and start delay.

## ðŸ”§ Usage

To use `LateSpatialDropout1D`:
```python
late_dropout = LateSpatialDropout1D(rate=0.5, start_step=100)
```

## ðŸ¤” Why LateSpatialDropout1D?

Initiating training with heavy regularization can sometimes slow down or hinder the convergence, especially when the model is trying to learn basic patterns in the data. By delaying the onset of dropout:

    - **Gradual Regularization:** The network gets a phase where it can learn without heavy constraints, making it adapt organically to the data.
    - **Training Stability:** Prevents potential instabilities or slow convergence that might arise from early, aggressive regularization.
    - **Improved Performance:** In certain cases, delaying dropout can lead to better validation accuracy as the model gets a chance to learn foundational patterns without interruption.
